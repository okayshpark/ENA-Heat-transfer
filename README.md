# ENA-Heat-transfer
This code was developed by Seonghyeok Park for the project of Engineering Numerical Analysis course in Yonsei University, Korea.

You have to create the 'model.stl' file to run the program for full operation.
You just need to make the room of 5m*5m*3m, and inside of it, you have to create n people with a diameter of 30cm and a height of 170cm.
But, if you don't want or don't know how to create it, use the attaced file instead.

Also, you need to install PDE toolbox from MATLAB website.
