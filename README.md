# ENA-Heat-transfer
This code was developed by Seonghyeok Park for the project of Engineering Numerical Analysis course in Yonsei University, Korea.

You have to create the 'model.stl' file to run the program fully. 
You just need to make the room of 5m*5m*3m, and inside of it, you have to create n people with a diameter of 30cm and a height of 170cm.

Also, you need to install PDE toolbox from MATLAB website.
